# Data Visualization with p5.js 
This is an early project done during my first year using the Javascript library p5.js where I used 4 different techniques to different datasets. 
The visualizations used are:
- Pixelated Animatls - Data on endangered animals where the image has been pixelated based on how many exist in the wild
- Donut Chart - A donut chart with the percetnages seperated by color with a hover feature that shows the numerical percetnage when hovered over
- Line Chart on climate change - Shows line chart with color coded background to show change in colors over time
- Waffle Chart - Shows results from a survery as a waffle chart
